# 🧠 Dyslexia Detection Pipeline

This project is a pipeline that helps predict the chances of dyslexia — categorized into **Low**, **Moderate**, or **High** risk levels — based on a quiz and survey.

## 🔍 Overview

The pipeline includes:

- A **survey** and **quiz** built with HTML + JavaScript to collect user responses.
- **Feature extraction** logic implemented on the front-end (browser).
- A **Colab notebook** that contains the trained machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) used for making predictions.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Complete the Survey and Quiz** on the website present in templates.
2. Scores will be calculated automatically and shown in an alert.
3. On the **Predict** page, you’ll find:
   - A step-by-step guide to run the prediction notebook.
   - An input section where you can enter your calculated scores.
4. Click the Colab link and follow instructions to run the model and get your diagnosis.
